## Getting Started (VS Code Dev Container)

1. **Install prerequisites:**
   - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - VS Code extension: _Dev Containers_

2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unicef-drp/dash.git
   cd dash
   ```

3. **Open the folder in VS Code** and choose **“Reopen in Container”**.  
   This will automatically build the environment and install dependencies.

4. **Run the app locally:**

   Open [http://localhost:8000/?prj=tm](http://localhost:8000/?prj=tm) in your browser once the container is running.

> Ensure Docker is running before opening VS Code.
