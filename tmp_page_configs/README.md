# Page configurations

This folder contains the page configurations for the two pilot projects: Brazil and ROSA.  
It is just a backup of the database contents, we put the jsons here, we validate it and we update the Database.  
This folder will not be needed anymore when we will move to a real database setup.  
We use this backup folder as the database is still a file embedded in the project and it is easy to overwrite it by mistake.

This folder can be deleted as soon as we move the data to the database
