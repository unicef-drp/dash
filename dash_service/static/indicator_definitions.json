The index is scored between 0.0 and 10.0., and the low values represent a positive performance, while the high values of the index represent a negative performance in terms of managing humanitarian risk. The values can be classified into five levels of risk: very low (0.0-1.9), low (2.0-3.4), medium (3.5-4.9), high (5.0-6.4), and very high (6.5-10.0).",
