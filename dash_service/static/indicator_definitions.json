    "CR_INFORM": "The INFORM Risk Index identifies countries at risk from humanitarian crises and disasters that could overwhelm national response capacity. It is made up of three dimensions - hazards and exposure, vulnerability and lack of coping capacity. They are conceptualized in a counterbalancing relationship: the risk of what (natural and human hazard), and the risk to what (population). The index is scored between 0.0 and 10.0., and the low values represent a positive performance, while the high values of the index represent a negative performance in terms of managing humanitarian risk. The values can be classified into five levels of risk: very low (0.0-1.9), low (2.0-3.4), medium (3.5-4.9), high (5.0-6.4), and very high (6.5-10.0).",
    "CR_INFORM_HA": "The hazard & exposure dimension of the INFORM Risk Index reflects the probability of physical exposure associated with specific hazards. There is no risk if there is no physical exposure, no matter how severe the hazard event is. Therefore, the hazard and exposure dimensions are merged into hazard & exposure dimension. As such it represents the load that the community has to deal with when exposed to a hazard event. The dimension comprises two categories: natural hazards and human-induced hazards, aggregated with the geometric mean, where both indexes carry equal weight within the dimension. The values for this dimension can be classified into five levels of risk: very low (0.0-1.4), low (1.5-2.6), medium (2.7-4.0), high (4.1-6.0), and very high (6.1-10.0).",

So, the vulnerability dimension represents economic, political and social characteristics of the community that can be destabilized in case of a hazard event. There are two categories aggregated through the geometric average, socio-economic vulnerability and vulnerable groups. The values for this dimension can be classified into five levels of risk: very low (0.0-1.9), low (2.0-3.2), medium (3.3-4.7), high (4.8-6.3), and very high (6.4-10.0).",
